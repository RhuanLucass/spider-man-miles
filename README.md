# Spider-Man: Miles Morales Project

This project was developed as part of the FrontPush course, aimed at enhancing design concepts in Figma, creating a lightweight library with SCSS, and exploring motion design, particularly using the GSAP library for animations, and utilizing the Tilt library for perspective animation when hovering over the image.
